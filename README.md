# Task Tracker Web App

## 📌 Overview

The Task Tracker Web App is a simple, interactive front-end application built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, with tasks stored persistently in the browser using **Local Storage**.

This project was created to demonstrate practical skills aligned with UNISA ICT modules, particularly in **Interactive Programming**, **Internet Programming**, and **Introduction to Programming**.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. The user enters a task in the input field.
2. JavaScript captures the form submission event.
3. A new task item is dynamically created and added to the task list.
4. The task is saved to Local Storage to ensure persistence.
5. On page reload, tasks are retrieved from Local Storage and displayed automatically.
